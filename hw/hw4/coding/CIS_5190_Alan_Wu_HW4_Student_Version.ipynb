One complication is that sentences come in different lengths, and we will need to keep track of this to correctly average.\n","\n","When a sentence is input into our network, it is mapped to list of token ids, up to some maximum length. We construct a matrix, M, where each row corresponds to a sentence, and entries correspond to integers representing tokens. Some sentences are, of course, shorter than this maximum length. For these sentences, we fill in the remaining elements of M with a pad index, up to the max length. This is a special pad index indicating we are beyond the end of a sentence. The dataloader takes care of this for you. When averaging, we need to ignore these elements.\n","\n","Irrespective of if a token is pad or a real token, the first step is to look up an embedding for the index in our embedding table (the first line of the forward method). At this point we will have retrieved some vectors that correspond to the pad tokens as well. We need to ignore these, and only average vectors that correspond to non-pad symbols.\n","\n","To help do so, often NLP applications will introduce a mask as part of the input. The mask is a binary vector for every sentence, where each position encodes whether the token is really from the sentence, or instead should be ignored. The shape of the mask is batch_size by maximum_length. Again, the dataloader has taken care of this for you. Your job will be to use this mask to ignore the embeddings components we don't want to average over.\n","\n","You have to perform the following steps:\n","\n","1. Change the view of the mask so it extends to the embeddings size. It started batch_size by maximum_length, but we need it to be batch_size by max_length by embed_dimension. The expand function will help.\n","2. Pointwise multiply the expanded mask with the embeddings, to eliminate the tokens that aren't in the mask, and sum the rest (this is the `numerator` of our average). Remeber the mask is a binary vector, so the zeros correspond to elements we don't want in our average. The output of this sum should be batch_size by embed_dimension.\n","4.
